Supported browsers
------------------

WireCloud 1.2 supports the following desktop browsers:

- Firefox 45+
- Chrome 52+
- Safari 10+
- Opera 39+

WireCloud 1.2 also works on the mobile version of the previous browsers, except
the wiring editor currently does not work with touch screens.

> **Note:** Although WireCloud supports those browsers, some widgets and operators
> may not support all of them. Read each widget and operators documentation for
> knowing if they have any restriction on the used browser.

Creating a new workspace
------------------------

Mashups in WireCloud are built in the context of **workspaces**. A
workspace consists of the set of widgets and operators that can be
mashed-up, even spanning multiple tabs. Widgets and operators in a
workspace can share data though data flow- or event-based mechanisms.

The workspace in use is shown in the upper area of the screen. It
resembles the well-known REST nomenclature. For example, the following
screenshot shows a workspace named "Workspace", pertaining the user
"admin" and running in the FIWARE Labâ€™s instance of WireCloud, i.e. it
is named admin/Workspace.

<img src="../images/user_guide/create_workspace/empty_workspace.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/create_workspace/empty_workspace.png 2x" alt="Empty workspace"/>

Near the workspace name there is a button which you can click on to
expand the workspace dropdown menu:

<img src="../images/user_guide/create_workspace/workspace_menu.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/create_workspace/workspace_menu.png 2x" alt="Workspace menu"/>

Once expanded, the menu shows a list of the already created workspaces
(see *Workspace*, *My Multimedia Workspace* and *IssueTrouble* in the
figure above) which allows you to quickly switch between them, followed
by a list of options:

-   **New workspace** creates a new workspace
-   **Rename** changes the name of the current workspace
-   **Share** shows the sharing configuration of the current workspace
-   **Upload to my resources** allows you to save the current
    workspace to the local catalogue for later usage
-   **Embed** shows information about how to embed the current workspace in other
    web pages
-   **Settings** changes the settings of the current workspace
-   **Remove** deletes the current workspace

If you want to create a new workspace named "History Info", choose *New
workspace* in the dropdown menu:

<img src="../images/user_guide/create_workspace/new_workspace_entry.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/create_workspace/new_workspace_entry.png 2x" alt="Click *New workspace*"/>

A dialog will pop up requiring a name for the new workspace. Type the
desired name and click the accept button:

<img src="../images/user_guide/create_workspace/new_workspace_dialog.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/create_workspace/new_workspace_dialog.png 2x" alt="Dialog for creating a new workspace"/>

Once accepted, the name of the new workspace is shown in the upper area of
the window:

<img src="../images/user_guide/create_workspace/new_workspace.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/create_workspace/new_workspace.png 2x" alt="History Info" workspace just after being created"/>

The following screenshot shows the "Settings" menu, where you can set
workspace features:

<img src="../images/user_guide/create_workspace/workspace_settings.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/create_workspace/workspace_settings.png 2x" alt="create_workspace/WorkspaceSettings.png"/>


Browsing the Marketplace
------------------------

A mashup tool like WireCloud must support access to **marketplaces**, where
people can offer and deal with services made accessible through widgets and
operators, like goods, and finally mash them up to create value added services
and applications.

On the marketplace you can quickly find and compare widgets and operators,
which enable you to attend an industry-ecosystem better than before. Widgets,
operators, and even pre-built mashups become tradable goods, which can be
offered and acquired on Internet based marketplaces. Partner companies and
other users can combine existing services to new services whereby new business
models will be incurred and the value added chain is extended.

The following figure shows a screenshot of WireCloud where you can see
the FIWARE Lab marketplace.

<img src="../images/user_guide/bae/summary.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/bae/summary.png 2x" alt="Initial marketplace view"/>


### Managing marketplaces

When looking for an offer of widgets, operators and mashups, you first need to
choose a marketplace. Use the dropdown menu shown in the workspace path for this
purpose.

<img src="../images/user_guide/bae/marketplace_dropdown.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/bae/marketplace_dropdown.png 2x" alt="Marketplace dropdown"/>

As shown in the previous screenshot, this menu allows you to choose among the
different marketplaces you have access to. To add a new marketplace, you only
need to provide its endpoint (URL). You can also delete the current markeplace
through the *Delete Marketplace* option in the context menu.

You can add the FIWARE Lab marketplace using the *Add new marketplace* option
as shown in the following screenshots:

<img src="../images/user_guide/bae/add_new_marketplace_entry.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/bae/add_new_marketplace_entry.png 2x" alt="Click *Add new marketplace*"/>

<img src="../images/user_guide/bae/add_new_marketplace_dialog.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/bae/add_new_marketplace_dialog.png 2x" alt="*Add new marketplace* dialog"/>

WireCloud offers a built-in local catalogue called *My Resources*, which allows
you to search among the widgets, operators and mashups currently available to
the user. The following figure shows a screenshot of the *My Resources* for a
user in a given instance of WireCloud.

<img src="../images/user_guide/browsing_marketplace/my_resources.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/browsing_marketplace/my_resources.png 2x" alt="*My Resources* view"/>

If you are a widget developer with brand new widgets to share, or you just have
downloaded a WireCloud-compliant widget from somewhere, you can easily upload
your new widgets to the built-in local catalogue through the *Upload* button
available on the *My Resources* view.

<img src="../images/user_guide/browsing_marketplace/upload_button.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/browsing_marketplace/upload_button.png 2x" alt="Click *Upload*"/>

<img src="../images/user_guide/browsing_marketplace/upload_dialog.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/browsing_marketplace/upload_dialog.png 2x" alt="MAC upload dialog"/>


Building a new mashup
---------------------

If you followed the instructions documented in the "[Creating a new
workspace](#creating-a-new-workspace)" section, you should
have a "History Info" workspace. Let's assume that we start from this
point:

<img src="../images/user_guide/create_workspace/new_workspace.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/create_workspace/new_workspace.png 2x" alt="Starting point"/>

Then go to the Marketplace to choose among the available components in the
catalogue those you want to use in your mashup:

<img src="../images/user_guide/building_mashup/get_more_components.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/building_mashup/get_more_components.png 2x" alt="Button for searching more components"/>

To ensure that you find the required widgets/operators for this example
mashup, go to the FIWARE Lab marketplace and install them using the
[*WireCloudUserGuide* offering](https://store.lab.fiware.org/#/offering/458).
You can also download them using the following URLs:

-   [CoNWeT_simple-history-module2linear-graph_2.3.2.wgt](attachments/CoNWeT_simple-history-module2linear-graph_2.3.2.wgt)
-   [CoNWeT_ngsi-source_3.0.7.wgt](attachments/CoNWeT_ngsi-source_3.0.7.wgt)
-   [CoNWeT_ngsientity2poi_3.0.3.wgt](attachments/CoNWeT_ngsientity2poi_3.0.3.wgt)
-   [CoNWeT_map-viewer_2.5.8.wgt](attachments/CoNWeT_map-viewer_2.5.8.wgt)
-   [CoNWeT_linear-graph_3.0.0b3.wgt](attachments/CoNWeT_linear-graph_3.0.0b3.wgt)

Once installed, you should be able to see all the widgets/operators used
in this example in the *My Resources* view:

<img src="../images/user_guide/browsing_marketplace/my_resources.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/browsing_marketplace/my_resources.png 2x" alt="List of used components"/>

Go to the editor view and click on the *Add components* button:

<img src="../images/user_guide/building_mashup/add_widget_button.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/building_mashup/add_widget_button.png 2x" alt="Click *Add conponents*"/>

Look for the *Linear Graph* widget and click on the *Add to workspace*
button:

<img src="../images/user_guide/building_mashup/add_linear_graph.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/building_mashup/add_linear_graph.png 2x" alt="Click *Add to workspace*"/>

This will add the *Linear Graph* widget into the dashboard, which you can move
and resize until you obtain the desired layout:

<img src="../images/user_guide/building_mashup/initial_linear_graph_layout.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/building_mashup/initial_linear_graph_layout.png 2x" alt="Initial *Linear Graph* layout"/>

Add the *Map Viewer* widget to the dashboard following the same steps
for adding the *Linear Graph* widget. After rearranging it you will be
presented with the following view, which shows you the two widgets in
the default tab. You can see the tabs used in your workspace at the
footer bar, and you can create new tabs to better organize the
distribution of the widgets in your mashup.

<img src="../images/user_guide/building_mashup/final_layout.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/building_mashup/final_layout.png 2x" alt="Final layout"/>

### Changing the settings of a widget

Once you have added the desired widgets to your mashup and you have
placed and resized them to configure the information dashboard of your
choice, you can change their settings. To do so, go to the upper-right
corner of the widget and click the properties icon as shown in the
following screenshot:

<img src="../images/user_guide/building_mashup/widget_menu_button.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/building_mashup/widget_menu_button.png 2x" alt="Widget *Menu* button"/>

You will then be presented with a dropdown menu with several options.

<img src="../images/user_guide/building_mashup/widget_menu_dropdown.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/building_mashup/widget_menu_dropdown.png 2x" alt="Widget menu dropdown"/>

-   **Rename** changes the widget name shown in workspace editor and
    wiring Editor views
-   **Reload** reloads the widget
-   **Upgrade/Downgrade** allows you to change the version of the widget
-   **Logs** shows a dialog with the log history of the widget
-   **Settings** shows a form for changing the settings of the current
    widget
-   **User's Manual** will open the widget documentation
-   **Full Dragboard** maximises the selected widget, so it will take up
    the full canvas area. This option becomes **Exit Full Dragboard** if
    the widget is already on "Full Dragboard" mode. In that case, this
    option will restore the size of the widget to the one it had before
    maximising it
-   **Extract from grid** lifts up the widget from the canvas, allowing
    you to place it wherever you want on the canvas, even on top of
    other widgets. This option becomes **Snap to grid** if the widget is
    currently outside the grid, in this case, this option docks the
    widget into the grid.

Finally, click on the **Settings** and you will be prompted with a
customised dialog for the settings of the widget. In this example, the
*Map Viewer* should be provided with initial location, zoom level and
mark shadow radius to customise the visualisation.

<img src="../images/user_guide/building_mashup/mapviewer_settings.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/building_mashup/mapviewer_settings.png 2x" alt="*Map Viewer* Settings"/>

> Note that you need to provide an API key to be able to use the widget
> correctly. You can get this from http://console.cloud.google.com/.
> For all features you need to activate the following APIs:
> -   Maps JavaScript API
> -   Maps Geocoding API
> See also the following documentation
> https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key.

As we have configured the initial position and the initial zoom, we need to
reload the widget. To do so, we click again on the properties icon and then on
the *Reload* option:

<img src="../images/user_guide/building_mashup/mapviewer_reload_entry.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/building_mashup/mapviewer_reload_entry.png 2x" alt="Reload option"/>

Now we have our widget centered in the new location, Santander, using the
configured initial zoom level.

<img src="../images/user_guide/building_mashup/mapviewer_configured.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/building_mashup/mapviewer_configured.png 2x" alt="MapViewer widget after being configured"/>

At this time, you have created a mashup with two individual widgets. The
*Linear Graph* widget is empty and needs to be wired with something that
provides information to draw, and the *Map Viewer* is a good option to
show any kind of "Points of Interest" and to allow the user to select them
easily.

<img src="../images/user_guide/building_mashup/workspace_mapviewer_configured.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/building_mashup/workspace_mapviewer_configured.png 2x" alt="Mashup with the map viewer configured"/>

### Wiring widgets and operators

Once you have chosen the desired widgets, you can wire them to enable
their intercommunication and to achieve coordinated behaviour. Widgets
and operators in WireCloud, are capable of sending and/or receiving
events and data through well-identified ports called endpoints. When you
connect two compatible endpoints, the second one (i.e. the input or
target endpoint) prepares to receive data flows and/or events coming
from the first one (i.e. the output or source endpoint).

#### Basic wiring concepts

To wire the widgets and add operators to your mashup go to the Wiring
view of the tool:

<img src="../images/user_guide/building_mashup/wiring_button.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/building_mashup/wiring_button.png 2x" alt="Click *Wiring*"/>

You will then be presented with an empty wiring configuration (denoted by an
empty canvas displaying a welcome message):

<img src="../images/user_guide/wiring/empty_wiring.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/wiring/empty_wiring.png 2x" alt="Emtpy wiring"/>

One of the most important characteristics that should be intrinsic to
the design of widgets is that they must be as generic as possible. For
example, it makes much more sense to have a generic *Map Viewer* widget
that can be wired through an operator to any source of information of
your choice, than to have a specific one that has hard-coded the data source.
Operators represent the means to achieve this generality,
because they represent the means to dynamically associate the widgets
with the concrete services or sources of information you want to use in
the context of a particular mashup.

In this case, we have an *NGSI source* operator that is going to
provide the data information to the *Map Viewer* widget. This kind of
operator is called piping operator. So we have to add it to the
wiring.

To do so, open the components side panel and search the *NGSI source* operator,
then click on the *Create* button:

<img src="../images/user_guide/wiring/create_operator_button.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/wiring/create_operator_button.png 2x" alt="Click *Create*"/>

This will create an instance of that operator and will appear in the bottom of
the box associated with the *NGSI Source* operator. You can see that it is
highlighted indicating that the new operator is not used in the wiring
configuration. All operators not used when leaving the wiring editor will be
removed from the wiring configuration.

Now drag the operator from the operator list to the wiring canvas:

<img src="../images/user_guide/wiring/add_ngsisource_sidebar.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/wiring/add_ngsisource_sidebar.png 2x" alt="Recently created operator in the sidebar"/>

<img src="../images/user_guide/wiring/add_ngsisource_drag.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/wiring/add_ngsisource_drag.png 2x" alt="Drag the *NGSI Source* operator"/>

<img src="../images/user_guide/wiring/add_ngsisource_finish.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/wiring/add_ngsisource_finish.png 2x" alt="*NGSI Source* added to the wiring canvas"/>

Once added, we need to configure it so it knows what info to retrieve from the
[Orion Context Broker] and from what instance. To do so, click on the
**Settings** menu entry:

<img src="../images/user_guide/wiring/ngsisource_settings.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/wiring/ngsisource_settings.png 2x" alt="NGSI Source Settings option"/>

And make sure the following configuration is used:

- **NGSI server URL**: `http://orion.lab.fiware.org:1026/`
- **NGSI proxy URL**: `https://ngsiproxy.lab.fiware.org`
- **Use the FIWARE credentials of the user**: Enabled
- **Use the FIWARE credentials of the workspace owner**: Disabled
- **NGSI tenant/service:** Empty
- **NGSI scope:** `/`
- **NGSI entity types**: `Node, AMMS, Regulator`
- **Id pattern**: Empty
- **Monitored NGSI attributes**: `Latitud, Longitud, presence, batteryCharge, illuminance, ActivePower, ReactivePower, electricPotential, electricalCurrent`

Now, the source of information that is going to be presented in the
*Map Viewer* widget is ready. So, the next step is adding the *Map Viewer*
widget to the wiring canvas, this way we will be able to connect them. This is
accomplished in the same way we did with the *NGSI Source* operator, but using
the *Widget* tab in the sidebar:

<img src="../images/user_guide/wiring/add_mapviewer_sidebar.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/wiring/add_mapviewer_sidebar.png 2x" alt="wiring/Wiring_NGSISource_MapViewer.png"/>

> **NOTE**: We have created the instance of the *Map Viewer* widget in the
> editor view, but you can also create widget instances from the wiring editor
> using the *Create* button:
>
> <img src="../images/user_guide/wiring/create_widget_button.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/wiring/create_widget_button.png 2x" alt="*Create* button"/>
>
> Remember to resize and place the new widget after exiting the wiring editor.

After adding the *Map Viewer* widget into the wiring canvas, you should have
something similiar to this:

<img src="../images/user_guide/wiring/wiring_after_adding_mapviewer.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/wiring/wiring_after_adding_mapviewer.png 2x" alt="Wiring diagram after adding the *Map Viewer* widget"/>

The wiring editor comes with a recommendation system for connections.
For example, move the pointer to the *Provide entity* endpoint. You will
see that the endpoint getd highlighted, this means that the recommendation
system is searching for compatible endpoints. In this case there are no
compatible endpoints.

<img src="../images/user_guide/wiring/missing_connection_recommendations.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/wiring/missing_connection_recommendations.png 2x" alt="Missing connection recommendations"/>

This is because the output of the *NGSI source* cannot be connected directly
to the *Map Viewer* widget. We can use a transform operator to convert the
event data provided by the *NGSI source* operator to the format used by the *Map
Viewer* widget. In this example, the operator that is going to perform this
transformation is called *NGSI Entity to PoI*:

<img src="../images/user_guide/wiring/wiring_after_adding_ngsientity2poi.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/wiring/wiring_after_adding_ngsientity2poi.png 2x" alt="Wiring diagram after adding the *NGSI Entity to PoI* operator"/>

After adding the operator, we can move the pointer to the *Provide
entity* endpoint to see that now we have a connection recommendation:

<img src="../images/user_guide/wiring/endpoint_recommendation.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/wiring/endpoint_recommendation.png 2x" alt="Connection recommendation over the *Provide entity* endpoint"/>

So, we can connect it. To do so, push down the mouse button on the
*Provide entity* endpoint and drag the arrow to the *Entity* endpoint:

<img src="../images/user_guide/wiring/ngsientity2poi_connection_dragging.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/wiring/ngsientity2poi_connection_dragging.png 2x" alt="Dragging a connection"/>
<img src="../images/user_guide/wiring/ngsientity2poi_connection_created.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/wiring/ngsientity2poi_connection_created.png 2x" alt="Created connection"/>

We also have to connect the *PoI* endpoint of the *NGSI Entity To PoI* operator
to the *Insert/Update PoI* endpoint on the *Map Viewer* widget:

<img src="../images/user_guide/wiring/wiring_after_connecting_ngsientity2poin_and_mapviewer.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/wiring/wiring_after_connecting_ngsientity2poin_and_mapviewer.png 2x" alt="Wiring diagram after connecting the *NGSI entity To PoI* operator and the *Map Viewer* widget"/>

Once again, we need to configure the *NGSI Entity To PoI* operator. This is done
in the same way as we have done with the *NGSI Source*. In this case the values
should be:

- **Coordinates attribute**: `Latitud, Longitud`
- **Marker Icon**: Empty

If you return to the *Editor* view, you will see that the map widget has
been updated and is showing the PoIs obtained from the *NGSI source*
operator.

<img src="../images/user_guide/wiring/mapviewer_with_entities.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/wiring/mapviewer_with_entities.png 2x" alt="Map Viewer widget displaying shome PoIs"/>

You can use the *Map Viewer* and moving its viewport, selecting PoI's, etc.
But really, what we have is not just the *Map Viewer* widget connected to
a source of data, but using piping and transformation operators which
gives us great flexibility.

#### Other wiring common tasks

One of the most common operations is the task of removing the connections
in the wiring. For example, when you make some mistake for some
reason, you can fix it by clicking the *Remove* button that appears in the
middle a of the connection:

<img src="../images/user_guide/wiring/delete_arrow1.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/wiring/delete_arrow1.png 2x" alt="*Remove* button"/>

Sometimes what you want is to modify one of the connections. The Wiring Editor
allows you to do this operation without having to remove the connection and
having to create a new one. To do so, you only have to select the connection and
drag the connection from the endpoint you want to modify:

<img src="../images/user_guide/wiring/modify_connection1.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/wiring/modify_connection1.png 2x" alt="How to modify a connection"/>
<img src="../images/user_guide/wiring/modify_connection2.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/wiring/modify_connection2.png 2x" alt="Dragging the new connection"/>
<img src="../images/user_guide/wiring/modify_connection3.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/wiring/modify_connection3.png 2x" alt="Connection once modified"/>
<img src="../images/user_guide/wiring/modify_connection4.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/wiring/modify_connection4.png 2x" alt="Connection once modified"/>

Another common task is to change the shape of connections. To do so, you have to
click on the *Customize* option of the connection:

<img src="../images/user_guide/wiring/reshape_arrow_pre.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/wiring/reshape_arrow_pre.png 2x" alt="*Customize* option"/>

Once enabled, you only have to move the handles that appear to modify the shape
of the connection.

<img src="../images/user_guide/wiring/reshape_arrow1.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/wiring/reshape_arrow1.png 2x" alt="wiring/reshape_arrow1.png"/>
<img src="../images/user_guide/wiring/reshape_arrow2.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/wiring/reshape_arrow2.png 2x" alt="wiring/reshape_arrow2.png"/>

If you want to stop customising the connection, click outside the connection or
use the *Stop Customizing* option:

<img src="../images/user_guide/wiring/reshape_arrow_stop.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/wiring/reshape_arrow_stop.png 2x" alt="*Stop Customizing* option"/>

You can also minimize operators with the intention of improving space
usage. This can be accomplished using the *Collapse* option that appears
in the component menu:

<img src="../images/user_guide/wiring/minimize_option.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/wiring/minimize_option.png 2x" alt="*Collapse* option"/>
<img src="../images/user_guide/wiring/collapsed_operators.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/wiring/collapsed_operators.png 2x" alt="Collapsed operators"/>

#### Concluding our example

Continue wiring the rest of the widgets in your mashup following your
intuition, the documentation and the contextual help offered by each
widget/operator. Finally, you should get to a final result similar to
the one in the following screenshot:

<img src="../images/user_guide/wiring/final_wiring.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/wiring/final_wiring.png 2x" alt="Final wiring configuration"/>

Now you can play with your new workspace.

Behaviour Oriented Wiring
-------------------------

Starting with WireCloud 0.8.0, you can create wiring configurations by means of
composing several *behaviours*.

A *behaviour* is a set of joined components with the connections established
between them for adding a feature or behaviour to the application mashup. For
example, we can split the wiring configuration used by the dashboard created on
the previous section into two behaviours:

- The first one can be called: **Show lampposts on map**. This behaviour is
  composed of the `NGSI Source`, `NGSI Entity To PoI` and `Map Viewer` components
  as well as the connections between those components:

  <img src="../images/user_guide/behaviour_oriented_wiring/santander_behaviour1.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/behaviour_oriented_wiring/santander_behaviour1.png 2x" alt="*Show lampposts on map* behaviour (Santander example)"/>

- The second one can be called: **Show lamppost details**. This behaviour is
  composed of the `Map Viewer`, `History Module to Linear Graph` and
  `Linear Graph` components as well as the connections between those components:

  <img src="../images/user_guide/behaviour_oriented_wiring/santander_behaviour2.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/behaviour_oriented_wiring/santander_behaviour2.png 2x" alt="*Show lampposts details* behaviour (Santander example)"/>

> Take into account that components and connections can be present in more than
> one behaviour. For example, in the previous example the *Map Viewer* widgets
> was used in both behaviours.

WireCloud will continue supporting the creation of application mashups without
having to use the behaviour methodology. However, by using this brand new
feature WireCloud provides several benefits:

- Splitting the wiring configuration into severals behaviours helps to provide a
  more organised and structured diagram as well as a way for documenting the
  reasons for using and connecting components in a particular way.
- Even though using the behaviour oriented wiring has a harder
  learning curve, using it eases the development of wiring configurations as it
  allows you to develop them using several phases.
- This documentation is also a good starting point for novice and experienced
  developers wanting to replicate the behaviour of a given
  application mashup. They only need to access the application mashups developed
  by other users and learn how the wiring configuration works by reading the
  behaviour descriptions.

### Enabling/disabling the behaviour engine

Before using the Behaviour Oriented methodology, it must be enabled. To do so,
go to the wiring editor view and click on the *List behaviours* button.

<img src="../images/user_guide/behaviour_oriented_wiring/list_behaviours_button.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/behaviour_oriented_wiring/list_behaviours_button.png 2x" alt="*List behaviours* button"/>

This will display a side panel, currently without any behaviour. Click on the
*Enable* button:

<img src="../images/user_guide/behaviour_oriented_wiring/enable_behaviours_button.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/behaviour_oriented_wiring/enable_behaviours_button.png 2x" alt="*Enable* behaviour engine button"/>

Once enabled, you will have a first behaviour with all the components and
connections previously added into the wiring configuration.

> *Note:* You can always go back to not use the behaviour engine by clicking on
> the *disable* button.
>
> <img src="../images/user_guide/behaviour_oriented_wiring/disable_behaviours_button.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/behaviour_oriented_wiring/disable_behaviours_button.png 2x" alt="*Disable* behaviour engine button"/>
>
> If you disable the behaviour engine, all components and connections will be
> squashed into a single view.

### Using the behaviour oriented wiring user interface

<img src="../images/user_guide/behaviour_oriented_wiring/general_aspect.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/behaviour_oriented_wiring/general_aspect.png 2x" alt="General aspect of the behaviour oriented wiring user interface"/>

This is the look of the wiring editor interface when the behaviour engine is
enabled. Each of the panels in the *Behaviours* section represents a
behaviour and displays the name and the description of the represented
behaviour.

Notice that one of the behaviours is highlighted, the currently active behaviour.
This is because you can edit only a behaviour at a time. The name
of the active behaviour is also displayed in the footer of the wiring editor, so
you always see which is the active behaviour (i.e. including when the
behaviour list panel is hidden). Changing the active behaviour is just a matter
of clicking on the panel representing the behaviour.

The other important thing to notice is that there are some "faded" components
inside the wiring canvas (e.g. the *Search For* widget). Background components are
faded because they do not form part of the active behaviour, although they form
part of other behaviours.

#### Adding components and creating connections

You can add new components into a behaviour in the same way they are added when
the behaviour engine is disabled. That is, by draging them from the component
side panel. The only thing you have to take into account is that those
components are only added into the active behaviour.

If you want to use a component already involved in another behaviour, you can use
the *Add* button of the background component you want to include:

<img src="../images/user_guide/behaviour_oriented_wiring/component_share_button.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/behaviour_oriented_wiring/component_share_button.png 2x" alt="Component *Add* button"/>

The same applies to the connections, if you create a new connection, that
connection is added only into the active behaviour. If you want to include a
connection already available on another behaviour, you can click on the *Add*
button of the background connection:

<img src="../images/user_guide/behaviour_oriented_wiring/connection_share_button.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/behaviour_oriented_wiring/connection_share_button.png 2x" alt="Connection *Add* button"/>

> **Note:** If a background connection implies background components, adding
> that connection will also add that background components into the active
> behaviour.

#### Creating a new behaviour

You can create new behaviours by clicking on the *Create behaviour* button
available on the list behaviour side panel:

<img src="../images/user_guide/behaviour_oriented_wiring/create_behaviour_button.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/behaviour_oriented_wiring/create_behaviour_button.png 2x" alt="*Create* behaviour button"/>

<img src="../images/user_guide/behaviour_oriented_wiring/new_behaviour_dialog.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/behaviour_oriented_wiring/new_behaviour_dialog.png 2x" alt="*New Behaviour* dialog"/>

If you want to edit the title and the description of a behaviour, you can open
the preferences menu and click on the *Settings* option:

<img src="../images/user_guide/behaviour_oriented_wiring/behaviour_settings_option.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/behaviour_oriented_wiring/behaviour_settings_option.png 2x" alt="Behaviour *Settings* option"/>

#### Removing behaviours

You can always remove a behaviour at any time, except when there is only one
behaviour (at least one behaviour must be present in a wiring configuration when
the behaviour engine is enabled). To do so, click on the *Remove* button of the
behaviour you want to remove:

<img src="../images/user_guide/behaviour_oriented_wiring/remove_behaviour_button.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/behaviour_oriented_wiring/remove_behaviour_button.png 2x" alt="*Remove* behaviour button"/>

> **Note:** All the components not used on other behaviour will be removed from
> the wiring configuration. Also take into account that this operation cannot be
> undone.

#### Removing components and connections

To remove a component from a behaviour, click on the *Delete* button:

<img src="../images/user_guide/behaviour_oriented_wiring/remove_component.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/behaviour_oriented_wiring/remove_component.png 2x" alt="*Remove* component button"/>

Components are only completely removed from the wiring configuration when they are
not used in any of the available behaviours.

The same applies to connections, you can remove them from the active behaviour
using the *Delete* button:

<img src="../images/user_guide/behaviour_oriented_wiring/remove_connection.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/behaviour_oriented_wiring/remove_connection.png 2x" alt="*Remove* connection button"/>

Again, connections are removed from the wiring configuration when they are removed
from all behaviours.

#### Ordering behaviours

The main purpose of the behaviour engine is to be able to document the wiring
configuration and, in that sense, humans tend to expose the ideas using a particular
order. With that being said, the Wiring Editor allows you to change the order used in the
behaviour list, but that order will not affect the wiring engine.

To change the behaviour order, you only have to click on the *Order behaviours*
button:

<img src="../images/user_guide/behaviour_oriented_wiring/order_behaviours_button.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/behaviour_oriented_wiring/order_behaviours_button.png 2x" alt="*Remove* connection button"/>

Once the ordering mode is activated, you will be able to drag and drop the behaviour
boxes:

<img src="../images/user_guide/behaviour_oriented_wiring/ordering_behaviours.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/behaviour_oriented_wiring/ordering_behaviours.png 2x" alt="Ordering behaviours"/>

Finally, click again on the *Order behaviours* button to exit the ordering mode:

<img src="../images/user_guide/behaviour_oriented_wiring/exit_order_behaviours_mode.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/behaviour_oriented_wiring/exit_order_behaviours_mode.png 2x" alt="Exit the ordering mode"/>

> **Note:** Anyway, you can also exit from the behaviour ordering mode by
> closing the sidebar or by opening the seach component form inside the sidebar.


Sharing your mashups
--------------------

Workspaces can be made public by means of modifying their settings as
follows:

1.  Click on the workspace menu button and click *Share*:
    <img src="../images/user_guide/wiring/share_workspace_entry.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/wiring/share_workspace_entry.png 2x" alt="*Share* option"/>

2.  You will be presented with a dialog for editing the sharing configuration of
    the workspace:
    <img src="../images/user_guide/wiring/share_workspace_dialog.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/wiring/share_workspace_dialog.png 2x" alt="Sharing settings dialog"/>

After making a workspace public, you will be able to share the workspace
URL with other users.

### Embedding mashups inside other web pages

All workspaces can be embedded, but take into account that access rules
are the same that applies when using the workspace directly from
WireCloud. If you don't make the workspace public, you will require
users to be logged in in WireCloud and having permission to access it.
This makes changing the sharing settings of the workspace a first step before
embedding mashups into other web pages.

You can also obtain the code you have to copy & paste into other web
pages by following these steps:

1.  Click on the workspace menu button and click *Embed*:
    <img src="../images/user_guide/wiring/embed_workspace_entry.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/wiring/embed_workspace_entry.png 2x" alt="*Embed* workspace option"/>

1.  A new window appears, showing you the code for embedding the mashup. Copy &
    paste it into your HTML document.
    <img src="../images/user_guide/wiring/embed_workspace_dialog.png" srcset="../images/user_guide/wiring/embed_workspace_dialog.png 2x" alt="Embed workspace dialog"/>
